# [Nerist CGPA](https://nerist-cgpa.netlify.app/)

Ever wondered how to calculate the CGPA or SGPA for Nerist? The formula is available on the `Academic Bye - Laws`. This website aims to make this process easier. I have always wanted to see how much marks, I need to get to get a certain grade. I have made a python implementaion but a website is just more universal.

## Run Locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chkg2a/nerist-cgpa &&
